NAME
    SVN::Notify::Mirror - Keep a mirrored working copy of a repository path

SYNOPSIS
    Use svnnotify in post-commit:

      svnnotify --repos-path "$1" --revision "$2" \
        --to "/path/to/www/htdocs" --handler Mirror \
            [--svn-binary /full/path/to/svn]

DESCRIPTION
    Keep a local directory in sync with a portion of a Subversion
    repository. Typically used to keep a development web server in sync with
    the changes made to the repository.

    NOTE: because 'svn export' is not able to be consistently updated, the
    sync'd directory must be a full working copy, and if you are running
    Apache, you should add lines like the following to your Apache
    configuration file:

      # Disallow browsing of Subversion working copy
      # administrative directories.
      <DirectoryMatch "^/.*/\.svn/">
       Order deny,allow
       Deny from all
      </DirectoryMatch>
