NAME
    SVN::Notify::Mirror - Keep a mirrored working copy of a repository path

DESCRIPTION
    Keep a directory in sync with a portion of a Subversion repository.
    Typically used to keep a development web server in sync with the changes
    made to the repository. This directory can either be on the same box as
    the repository itself, or it can be remote.

    NEW in this version is:
    	- support for multiple transport backends( SSH and Rsync)
	- support for switching to a newly created tag (instead of
	  just updating a working copy)

    NOTE: Please use SVN::Notify::Mirror::SSH directly for all new
    installs.  The compatibility feature to pass through ssh-* options
    will be removed in version 0.05.  See the POD for more details.

INSTALLATION
    Install Module::Build and then run:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ ./Build
    $ su
    # ./Build install


TESTING
    If you have the optional Net::SSH module installed, you can test it if
    you have the following configured:

    1) a personal ssh key (located in the default ~.ssh location);
    2) your key does not have a password;
    3) you have already used that key to connect successfully to localhost.

    Normally, once you have a personal ssh key, you can simply do

        $ ssh localhost

    and respond to the prompt to add locahost to the list of known_hosts.
    If this is not true, answer 'N' to the prompt during ./Build.
