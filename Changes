2006-07-06  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Ready to release to CPAN (now that SVN-Notify-Config is fixed).

2006-06-30  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	This should be working but is having some problems

2006-06-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Quick release to cope with backwards incompatible API changes in
	SVN::Notify 2.61.  Don't release until POD is rewritten and I hear from
	Audrey Tang about SVN::Notify::Config fixes (to add to README).

2006-02-24  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL
	    Depend on the newly minted SVN::Notify-2.53.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Use SVN::Notify->find_exe() to locate the 'svn' binary.

2006-02-24  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Further improvements in making sure that the svn_binary is found.

2006-02-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL
	    Add explicit dependency on SVN::Notify. Duh.

	* README
	  lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Improve documentation of optional features.

2006-02-17  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Don't hardcode path to svn executable.

2006-02-16  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Older Subversion clients choke if you give them the repos path when they
	weren't expecting it (go figure).

2006-01-03  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Release 0.03 to CPAN.

	* README
	    Clarify a few points.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Bump the $VERSION.

2005-12-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	One last file to add.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror/Rsync.pm
	    Forgot to add this back to the repository in its current form.

2005-12-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Nearly forgot to add files to the MANIFEST.

	* MANIFEST
	    Add Rsync.pm and tests for same.

2005-12-29  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	* Build.PL
	    Add support structure for Rsync class.

	* README

	    New test for Rsync transport method.

2005-12-28  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Ready to release alpha code to CPAN.

	* MANIFEST
	    Need to add new file or it doesn't get included in tar.

	* README
	    Mention Mirror::SSH in example.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror/Rsync.pm
	    Take this out until design questions are resolved.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Bump $VERSION and standardize whitespace.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Tweak $changes slightly to test empty updates, too.

	* t/survey_repos
	    First pass at improving code to autogenerate test cases.

2005-12-28  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Finally have tests succeeding 100% (not testing Rsync yet).

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Rework test framework to only test the right things at
	    the right time.

	* t/002_config.t.PL
	    Change test to call SVN::Notify::Mirror::SSH directly.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Add compatibility for SSH call for next release.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror/SSH.pm
	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror/Rsync.pm

2005-12-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Split out the SSH and add Rsync subclasses (tests still not working).

	* t/coretests.pm
	    More tweaks to test framework but still no solution.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Remove SSH code and place in seperate file.
	    Deprecate using SSH from parent module.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror/SSH.pm
	    Completely working subclass based on code stripped from parent.

	    Suggested by Guillaume Rousse <Guillaume.Rousse@inria.fr>

2005-12-27  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Tests 001_basic.t and 003_sshtest.t pass 100% but 002_config.t
	fails due to out-of-order evaluation.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Simplify non-switch path.
	    Chop URL from wc and source on /tags/ then stitch together.
	    Echo the command run in the error case.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Working test framework to loop over each WC in turn.
	    _compare_directories() stubbed out for now.

2005-12-26  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Interim commit (tests still fail).

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Add wc_map to try and make it easier to keep track of
	    what wc contains what path.

	* t/test-repos.dump
	    Actually didn't save the correct dumpfile last time.

2005-12-26  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Complexify the testing regime to handle realworld repositories
	with multiple projects.  Testing does not work yet.

	* t/recreate
	  t/survey_repos
	    Private scripts to recreate the repository and to survey
	    the repository structure and create the appropriate test
	    structure within coretests.pm.

	    Partially updated with new repository structure (tests fail).

	    New repository dump (not really related to previous dump).

2005-12-24  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Completely working switch feature.

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm

2005-12-23  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Working switch case for tags, but only on local dir.

	* MANIFEST
	    Need to have Makefile.PL so `release` doesn't get confused

	* lib/SVN/Notify/Mirror.pm
	    Rename all internal attributes to use underscore (as this is
	      what YAML does anyways.
	    Add 'switch' case for tags.

	* t/002_config.t.PL
	    Add stanza for 'tags/' path.

	* t/coretests.pm
	    Add new wc-tag directory.

	All three testfiles working (though not optimal)

2005-11-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Working 001 and 003 tests.  002 test does something, but
	need more robust way to check it.

2005-11-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Fix stupid global replace errors.

2005-11-20  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	 r435@dsl092-168-024:  jpeacock | 2005-11-16 16:49:43 -0500
	 Implement support for remote mirrors via ssh

2005-09-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	For some reason, I never added this to the repository before
	releasing to CPAN.  I'm not even sure where I did this
	development now... ;-)

2005-09-11  John Peacock <jpeacock@cpan.org>

	Directory for svk import.
